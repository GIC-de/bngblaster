BNG Blaster
===========

The **BNG Blaster** is an open-source network tester 
for access and routing protocols. It can emulate a huge amount of 
PPPoE and IPoE (DHCP) subscribers including IPTV, and L2TP (LNS). 
There are various routing protocols supported like ISIS and BGP. 
So you can use it for end-to-end BNG and non-BNG router testing.

You can use the included traffic generator for forwarding verification,
QoS testing or to measure convergence times. The traffic generator supports 
millions of separate tracked flows. This allows you to verify every single 
forwarding state of a full-feed internet routing table. You can also send 
traffic to every single QoS queue of your service edge router with detailed 
per-flow statistics like receive rate, loss or latency.

The BNG Blaster is used by leading network operators like Deutsche Telekom AG
with their famous Access 4.0 project, network hard- and software vendors like
RtBrick and many more.

from `DENOG13 <https://youtu.be/LVg6rlVEfNU>`_ can be found on YouTube. There is 
also an article in the 
`APNIC blog <https://blog.apnic.net/2022/05/26/bng-blaster-the-open-network-tester-for-the-ip-networking-community/>`_ 
where we explained our motivation for this project.

The BNG Blaster has been completely built from scratch in **C**. This includes user-space implementations 
of the entire protocol stack. The core is based on a very simple event loop that serves timers and 
signals. The timers have been built using a lightweight constant time (*O(1)*) library. The 
`timer library <https://github.com/rtbrick/bngblaster/blob/main/code/common/src/timer.h>`_
was built to start, restart and delete the protocol session FSM timers quickly and at scale.

This project will be actively maintained and further evolved by RtBrick. We are fully committed to building 
a project for the community and take issue and enhancement requests seriously. We are looking forward to any 
kind of contributions, new features, bug fixes, or tools. Even contributions to the documentation are more 
than welcome.

If you are interested in the BNG Blaster, or simply looking to find out more about it, we recommend going through 
the examples in the quick start guide.

Our mission is to build better networks with open test suites.
