The BNG Blaster is an open-source network tester 
for access and routing protocols. It can emulate massive 
PPPoE and IPoE (DHCP) subscribers including IPTV, and L2TP (LNS). 
There are various routing protocols supported like ISIS, OSPF and BGP. 
So you can use it for end-to-end BNG and non-BNG router testing.

You can use the included traffic generator for forwarding verification,
QoS testing or to measure convergence times. The traffic generator supports 
millions of separate tracked flows. This allows you to verify every single 
forwarding state of a full-feed internet routing table. You can also send 
traffic to every single QoS queue of your service edge router.

The BNG Blaster is used by leading network operators like Deutsche Telekom AG
with their famous Access 4.0 project, network hard- and software vendors like
RtBrick and many more.
